# NYC Scout Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

## What NYC Scout Does

NYC Scout is an Instagram DM bot that helps you find restaurants and events in New York City, and optionally connects you with others who want to attend the same events.

## What Data We Collect

### When You Message Us

We store your **Instagram Scoped ID** (a unique identifier Meta provides for our business account - not your username or profile info) along with:

- **Food preferences**: dietary restrictions, budget preference, preferred borough, favorite cuisines
- **Conversation context**: your last search, shown results (to avoid repeats), current conversation state
- **Timestamps**: when you first messaged us, last activity

### If You Opt Into Social Matching

If you choose to use our "Find someone to go with" feature, we additionally store:

- **Borough preference**: where you're willing to go
- **Vibe**: your going-out style (chill, social, party, activity-focused)
- **Availability**: when you usually go out (weeknights, weekends, anytime)
- **Group size preference**: 1 person, small group, or any

**We do NOT store:**
- Your name
- Your Instagram username (until you explicitly share it with a match)
- Your photo
- Your age, school, or job
- Any other personal information

## How Social Matching Works

1. **Anonymous profiles**: When you browse potential matches, you only see: borough, vibe, availability, and group size. No names or handles.

2. **Two-way consent**: Your Instagram handle is ONLY shared after:
   - You request to connect with someone
   - They accept your request
   - Both parties have explicitly agreed

3. **No unsolicited contact**: We never share your information with anyone who hasn't opted in. We never message users who haven't messaged us first.

## Match Requests

- Match requests expire after **30 minutes**
- You can send up to **10 match requests per day**
- If someone declines your request, you cannot send them another request for **24 hours**
- Declined requests are private - the requester is not notified

## Your Rights & Controls

You can type these commands anytime:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `delete my data` | Permanently deletes ALL your data (food preferences, social profile, match history) |
| `opt out` | Removes you from social matching but keeps your food/event preferences |
| `stop matching` | Pauses matching (you can resume later by saying "start matching") |
| `report` | Reports your most recent match if something feels off |
| `reset` | Clears your conversation context to start fresh |

## Data Security

- All data is stored in MongoDB with encryption at rest
- We use Instagram's official Messaging API
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties
- We do not use your data for advertising

## What We Don't Do

- ❌ We don't scrape Instagram profiles

- ❌ We don't access your followers or following lists
- ❌ We don't post on your behalf

- ❌ We don't message users who haven't messaged us first

## Data Retention

- **Active users**: Data is retained while you use the service
